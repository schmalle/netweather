# URL Reachability Implementation Summary

## Overview
The NetWeather application has been enhanced with comprehensive URL reachability checking functionality. This feature checks if URLs are accessible via HTTP, HTTPS, or both, follows redirects, and stores detailed reachability information in the database.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Protocol Detection and Testing
- Automatically detects if a URL has a protocol (http:// or https://)
- For URLs without protocol, tests both HTTP and HTTPS variants
- Records which protocols are available for each URL

### 2. Redirect Handling
- Follows up to 10 redirects per URL
- Stores both the original and final URLs
- Records intermediate redirect URLs for both HTTP and HTTPS

### 3. Status Code Tracking
- Records HTTP response status codes for each protocol
- Helps identify successful connections (2xx), redirects (3xx), and errors (4xx, 5xx)

### 4. Timeout Management
- Uses a 10-second timeout for each connection attempt
- Prevents hanging on unresponsive servers
- Allows efficient scanning of large URL lists

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Only scans JavaScript libraries when HTTP 200 status code is received
- Skips scanning for error pages (4xx, 5xx) and redirects without final 200 status
- Reduces unnecessary network requests and processing time

### 6. Verbose Output Control
- Added `--verbose` flag (default: false) for detailed output control
- Non-verbose mode: Shows only successfully scanned URLs with progress indicators
- Verbose mode: Shows all URLs including non-200 responses and detailed library information
- Progress counter with dots and periodic count updates in non-verbose mode

### 7. Database Storage
- New `url_reachability` table stores all reachability data
- Tracks:
  - Original URL from input file
  - HTTP/HTTPS availability (boolean)
  - Status codes for each protocol
  - Redirect URLs (if any)
  - Final URL after all redirects
  - Scan timestamp

### 6. Enhanced Statistics
- Added URL reachability statistics to the `-stats` command
- Shows:
  - Total URLs checked
  - HTTP-only URLs
  - HTTPS-only URLs
  - URLs supporting both protocols
  - Unreachable URLs
  - URLs with redirects

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **reachability.go** - Core reachability checking logic
2. **scripts/create_url_reachability_table.sql** - Database schema
3. **scripts/test_reachability.sh** - Testing script

### Modified Files
1. **main.go** - Integrated reachability checking into scanning workflow
2. **database.go** - Added storage and statistics functions
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated documentation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE url_reachability (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    original_url VARCHAR(2083) NOT NULL,
    http_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    https_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    http_status_code INT,
    https_status_code INT,
    http_redirect_url VARCHAR(2083),
    https_redirect_url VARCHAR(2083),
    final_url VARCHAR(2083),
    scanned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Create a URL file without protocols
echo "google.com" > urls.txt
echo "github.com" >> urls.txt
echo "example.com" >> urls.txt

# Run in non-verbose mode (default, clean output)
./netweather -db -db-user user -db-password pass -db-name netweather urls.txt

# Run in verbose mode (detailed output)
./netweather -verbose -db -db-user user -db-password pass -db-name netweather urls.txt
```

### View Statistics
```bash
# Show all statistics including reachability
./netweather -stats -db-user user -db-password pass -db-name netweather
```

### Mixed Protocol URLs
```bash
# URLs with and without protocols
echo "https://github.com" > mixed_urls.txt
echo "google.com" >> mixed_urls.txt
echo "http://example.com" >> mixed_urls.txt
echo "www.cloudflare.com" >> mixed_urls.txt

./netweather -db -db-user user -db-password pass -db-name netweather mixed_urls.txt
```

## Output Format
When scanning, the application now shows:
1. Reachability status (HTTP/HTTPS availability with status codes)
2. Redirect detection notification
3. Final URL if different from original
4. Either proceeds with JavaScript library scanning OR skips if no HTTP 200

Example outputs:

**Successful scan (HTTP 200)**:
```
Processing URL: google.com
  - Reachable via: HTTP (301), HTTPS (200)
  - Redirects detected
  - Final URL: https://www.google.com/
  - Scanning for JavaScript libraries...
    Library: Google Analytics (url-pattern) [e9bfcbdb...]
```

**Skipped scan (non-200 response) - Verbose mode**:
```
Processing URL: https://httpbin.org/status/404
  - Reachable via: HTTPS (404)
  - Skipping JavaScript scan (no HTTP 200 response)
```

**Non-verbose mode output**:
```
NetWeather - URL Scanner
Processing 6 URLs...
Progress: 
[1/6] Scanning: https://www.google.com → 0 scripts found
[4/6] Scanning: https://github.com → 57 scripts found
[6/6] Scanning: http://example.com → 0 scripts found 6

Scan completed!
Total URLs processed: 6
Successfully scanned: 3
Skipped (non-200): 2
Errors/Unreachable: 1
```

## Benefits
1. **Pre-flight Check**: Avoids wasting time on unreachable URLs
2. **Protocol Discovery**: Automatically finds the best protocol to use
3. **Redirect Resolution**: Scans the actual destination, not just the input URL
4. **Historical Data**: Database storage allows tracking URL availability over time
5. **Bulk Processing**: Efficient handling of large URL lists with timeouts
6. **Performance Optimization**: Skips JavaScript scanning for error pages (4xx, 5xx)
7. **Resource Efficiency**: Only downloads and processes JavaScript from successful pages
8. **Clean Output**: Non-verbose mode reduces console clutter for large URL lists
9. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators show scan advancement

## Testing
Use the provided test script:
```bash
cd scripts
./test_reachability.sh
```

This will test various URL scenarios and display the database results.
