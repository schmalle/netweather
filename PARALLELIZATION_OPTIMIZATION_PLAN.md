# NetWeather Parallelization Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Bottlenecks Analysis

### 1. Sequential Processing Issues
- **URLs processed one by one**: Each URL must complete before the next begins
- **Network I/O blocking**: HTTP requests are synchronous, wasting CPU time
- **API calls serialized**: Library identification API calls happen sequentially
- **Database writes serialized**: Each result stored individually

### 2. Time-Consuming Operations Identified
1. **URL Reachability Checks** (15s timeout per URL)
   - HTTP request (network latency)
   - HTTPS request (network latency + SSL handshake)
   - Redirect following (additional requests)
   
2. **JavaScript Library Scanning**
   - HTML parsing (CPU-bound, fast)
   - Script downloading (network I/O)
   - Checksum computation (CPU-bound, fast)
   - API identification calls (network I/O)
   
3. **Database Operations**
   - Connection overhead
   - Individual INSERT statements

## Parallelization Strategy

### Phase 1: URL-Level Parallelization (High Impact)

#### Design Pattern: Worker Pool
```go
type URLJob struct {
    URL           string
    Index         int
    OriginalIndex int
}

type URLResult struct {
    Job           URLJob
    Reachability  *URLReachability
    ScanResults   []ScanResult
    Error         error
    Excluded      bool
    Skipped       bool
}
```

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Master Goroutine**: Manages URL queue and result collection
2. **Worker Pool**: N goroutines processing URLs concurrently
3. **Result Collector**: Goroutine handling database writes and progress updates
4. **Progress Tracker**: Thread-safe counter for UI updates

#### Concurrency Controls
- **Worker Pool Size**: Configurable (default: 5-10 workers)
- **Rate Limiting**: Delay between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Timeout Management**: Per-operation timeouts with context cancellation
- **Backpressure**: Bounded channels to prevent memory explosion

### Phase 2: JavaScript Script-Level Parallelization (Medium Impact)

#### Within-URL Parallelization
For each URL with multiple JavaScript files:
```go
// Parallel script processing within a single URL
func scanURLScripts(baseURL string, scripts []string, useDB bool, verbose bool) []ScanResult {
    scriptJobs := make(chan string, len(scripts))
    results := make(chan ScanResult, len(scripts))
    
    // Launch script workers
    for i := 0; i < min(len(scripts), maxScriptWorkers); i++ {
        go scriptWorker(baseURL, scriptJobs, results, useDB, verbose)
    }
    
    // Send jobs and collect results
}
```

### Phase 3: Database Optimization (Medium Impact)

#### Batch Database Operations
1. **Batch Inserts**: Accumulate results and insert in batches
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
3. **Prepared Statements**: Reduce SQL parsing overhead
4. **Transaction Batching**: Group multiple inserts in single transaction

#### Implementation
```go
type DatabaseBatcher struct {
    reachabilityBuffer []URLReachability
    scanResultBuffer   []ScanResult
    batchSize         int
    flushInterval     time.Duration
}
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Concurrency Settings
```go
type ConcurrencyConfig struct {
    MaxURLWorkers     int           // Default: 8
    MaxScriptWorkers  int           // Default: 4  
    RequestDelay      time.Duration // Default: 100ms
    BatchSize         int           // Default: 50
    FlushInterval     time.Duration // Default: 5s
}
```

### Command Line Flags
```bash
--workers N          # Number of concurrent URL workers (default: 8)
--script-workers N   # Number of script workers per URL (default: 4)
--request-delay MS   # Delay between requests in ms (default: 100)
--batch-size N       # Database batch size (default: 50)
```

## Safety & Reliability Measures

### 1. Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing if some URLs fail
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts for transient failures
- **Error Aggregation**: Collect and report all errors at end

### 2. Resource Management
- **Memory Limits**: Bounded channels and buffers
- **Goroutine Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup and cancellation
- **Connection Limits**: Respect system and target server limits
- **CPU Throttling**: Avoid overwhelming the host system

### 3. Progress Tracking
- **Thread-Safe Counters**: Atomic operations for progress tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Non-blocking progress updates
- **Order Preservation**: Results can be processed out-of-order internally

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Theoretical Speedup Calculations

#### Current Performance (Sequential)
- Average URL scan time: ~3-5 seconds
- 100 URLs = 300-500 seconds (5-8 minutes)

#### With Parallelization (8 workers)
- Same URLs processed concurrently
- Expected time: 50-80 seconds (1-1.5 minutes)
- **Speedup: 6-8x improvement**

#### Limiting Factors
1. **Network Bandwidth**: May become bottleneck with high concurrency
2. **Target Server Limits**: Rate limiting or connection limits
3. **Database Performance**: Insert throughput limitations
4. **Memory Usage**: Increased memory for concurrent processing
